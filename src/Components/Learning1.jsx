          We follow a unique model called LRPA. With the motto 'learning through
          fun', we make learning of core theories and values in the class fun
          filled and exciting. We believe in experiential learning. Through
          exploration, students are allowed to experience firsthand learning
          experiences. The classroom activities are not confined to the books.
          Through active participation, children learn to think critically over
          any situation, analyze rationally and draw logical conclusion. All
          classroom activities are supported by modern classroom technology and
          adequate resources. Students are allowed to use a wide range of
          electronic gadgets like computers, laptops, television and projectors
          to reinforce their subjective knowledge. Students carry out several
          project works in each subject, use various audio visual and print
          media, and use ample interaction with concerned seniors to strengthen
          the learnt theory. Ample educational field trips, national and
          international tours, talk shows are thus included as essentials in our
          curriculum. Through experiments, problem solving, model preparation,
          audio visual presentation, drama, role play, tutorial classes, virtual
          learning group works, conferences, they put the learnt concepts into
          practice and finally apply them or seek their application in real life
          situations.
